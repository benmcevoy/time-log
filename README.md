# time-log
Keep a log of my professional work. The log comes in handy for reviewing any changes I made have made in the distant past, any notes or conversations and generally as a personal record that supplements change control, timesheeting and so on.

The log is just a text file.

A WPF app provides a basic editor and parses out entries, helping to keep track of hours spent.
